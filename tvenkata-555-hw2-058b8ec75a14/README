  To run the HW1 server, Configuration has been already added to pom.xml.

  Build the code by mvn clean install
  Run the server by : mvn exec:java@webHw1 "-Dexec.args={db path} {root path}". Note that tag for this HW1 server is  webHw1.

  src/main/java/edu/upenn/cis/cis455/crawler/WebInterfaceHw1.java is the main class for HW1 server.
